# Getting started

3. Set up Firebase

Firebase is a real-time cloud database that helps you build apps without building the backend. You can save and retrieve JSON objects, build user authentication, and get data updates in real-time. All we need for a chat app

Create a new Firebase app on [your Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). You’ll need a Google Account.

Rename file from `firebase.exmaple.js` to `firebase.js` that can be found by the path: *app/configs/firebase.js* the config from your Firebase account and paste it to firebase.js

```js
export const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "apikey",
    authDomain: "name.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://name.firebaseio.com/"
}
```
